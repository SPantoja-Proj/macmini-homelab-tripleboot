## Setup

## macOS Update and Preparation

-Begin by checking which version of macOS the Mac Mini is currently running.

-Verify whether this version is the latest operating system supported by the device.

-Once the appropriate macOS version has been downloaded and installed, you can proceed with partitioning the system.

`Warning` I do not recommend attempting to install a macOS version that is not officially supported on the Mac Mini.
